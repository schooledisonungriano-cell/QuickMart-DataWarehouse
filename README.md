# QuickMart Data Warehouse Project

## Tool Selection Justification

The following tools were selected to ensure efficiency, scalability, and ease of collaboration:

### 1. Data Storage & Warehouse
**Snowflake** – Chosen for its cloud-native architecture, ability to handle large datasets, and support for both structured and semi-structured data.

### 2. Data Transformation
**dbt (Data Build Tool)** – Allows modular SQL-based transformations, version control integration, and automated documentation.

### 3. Visualization & Reporting
**Power BI** – Selected for its rich visualization features, integration with multiple data sources, and ease of use for generating business dashboards.

### 4. Dataset Format
**CSV Files** – Used for sample datasets because they are lightweight, human-readable, and compatible with most data tools.

### 5. Version Control & Collaboration
**GitHub** – Enables collaborative development, version control, and centralized access to all project files.
